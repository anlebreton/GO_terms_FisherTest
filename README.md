# GO_terms_FisherTest
Initially created to find significant differences of GO categories occurrences among a set of species

input is a tabular file without header (yet), comparisons are made starting at the 3rd column to the end. 
I used it with first column corresponding to biological_process, molecular_function or cellular_component, second column with a description of GO term, other columns are the number of occurence of the corresponding GO term with each column corresponding to a species.
